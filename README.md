# Stock Sector Change Information System
This a project from a graduate-level data analytics course.These codes aims to deal with stock information for different sectors. There are three steps:

## Step 1: collect data with web scraping
Wrote a web scraper to grab stock information for different sectors from  Google Finance each day. For example, grabbed the stock name and change for the top gainers, top losers and top actives of every sector.

## Step 2: store data with MongoDB
Constructed MongoDB database to store these data and updated the collection as new stock data arrived

## Step 3: analyze stock information using database
Designed interface with the database to analyze sector changes. For example, which sector has had the greatest move on a given date? Which stock has had the greatest move for the whole period?
